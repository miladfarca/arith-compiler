# arith-compiler
Implementing an arithmetic Interpreter and Compiler.

In this project I will be writing an Interpreter/Compiler in C to do basic
arithmetic computation.

We will follow the methods explained in `the dragon book (Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools)`. 
We will start by writing a lexical analyzer and a `Recursive Decent`, top down parser.
